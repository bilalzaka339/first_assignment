 hi!
 I'm Bilal.
 A student of Software Engineering in UAF.
 Currently in my 7th semester.
 I'm interested in learning about the basics of Generative AI.
 As of now, i've joined a course, offered by PIAIC in Faisalabad.
 I'm excited to learn and explore the world of Generative AI.
 I'm looking forward to learning from this community and contributing to it as well.
