# first_assignment
 hi!
 I'm Bilal.
 A student of Software Engineering in UAF.
 Currently in my 7th semester.
 I'm interested in learning about the basics of Generative AI.
 As of now, i've joined a course, offered by PIAIC in Faisalabad.
 I'm excited to learn and explore the world of Generative AI.
 I'm looking forward to learning from PIAIC and contributing to it as well.
 I'm assigned to submit the repository with more than 1 commits.
 I'll be using this repository to store my assignments and projects related to Generative AI.
